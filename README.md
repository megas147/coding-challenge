# coding-challenge
I put the data for the organisation in 2 different json files to make it dynamic and used jsonschema
to handle the schema validation, then i used anytree package to handle the internals of the organisation tree structure.

# # Considerations for future iterations
- Use a business rules engine
- Read settings from a json file
- Use a proper testing framework like pytest or Selenium
